Assignment for making a simple GUI with two labels(number 1 & number 2) & their respective input fields with 4 buttons (add, subtract, multiplty & divide). Made using AWT & Swing packages in java.

All the classes used fall under the ```java.awt``` package expect for the class starting with J that fall under ```javax.swing``` package. And the methods are same in both the packages.
```.setBounds()``` accepts 4 parameters in integer values they are: x-coordinate, y-coordinate, width & height. This method is used to set the position and size of the component that we use it on.
```.setSize()``` method accepts two parameters i.e width & height to set the size of the frame component.
```.setVisible()``` accepts boolean value and sets the visibility of the component according to the value provided.
```.setLayout()``` takes in layout manager as a parameter and sets the layout of frame according the layout manager provided.
